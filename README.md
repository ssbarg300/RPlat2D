# RPlat2D
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/KREsNAPVypM>
#### Description:
RPlat2D is a simple 2d platformer made in unity i made this project to
teach myself game developement in unity and i didnt make a very complex project for cs50
due to not having time but overall im proud of how the game came out to be, Also a disclaimer.
All the 2d art wasnt made by me i downloaded an asset that had all the art so i can make the levels and the player
so if your wondering what asset i used its called: Pixel Adventure 1. And you can find it in the unity asset store.
Anyways this was my final project for cs50!.

While RPlat2D may not be overly complex, I am proud of the final product and the skills I gained
through the development process.

### Resources:

The main resource i used is the unity documentation.

Unity Docs: <https://docs.unity.com>

### Controls:
Controls are pretty simple.

d. for right

a. for left

space. for jumping.
### Nice to have(s):

this is a list of what i would like to add to the game

1. Multiple levels. Now this is easy but im too lazy to add new levels its just drag and drop elements

2. More gameplay mechanics: like double jump and shooting(so i should add enemies too)

3. Change the art: i will definitely change the Pixel Adventure 1 asset to my own in the future

And thats About all i like to add for the game.

### features in the game that are cool(maybe only to me lol):
1. Moving Platform:
    during the developement i found a way to make a moving platform script that can apply anywhere.
    What i mean is i didnt hardcode the coordinates of the startpoint and endpoint of the platform,
    what i did is i made the platform move to an empty game object named startPoint then the direction
    variable changes to 2 so the platform can move to the end, this allows the platform to be adopted basically anywhere. Now i didnt invent this, this is actually quite a popular method, but im proud of making it.
Im yet to add some more cool features.
